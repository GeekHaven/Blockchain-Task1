# Blockchain-Task1

Setup your Metamask as demonstrated above. And request faucet from [Rinkeby](https://www.rinkebyfaucet.com/.)

Your task is to create a folder named <your-github-username> in the root directory.
In that folder, you have to create <your-github-username>.json
  ```JAVA
{
    "address" : "your-public-key",
    "transaction-link": "https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/<txn-hash>",

    "name" : "Your-name",
    "username" : "github-username",
    "roll number" : "your-rollnumber"
}
  ```
You also have to add the snapshot of that transaction from [Etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/) in the same folder.
